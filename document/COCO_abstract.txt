We present a new algorithm based on the $\beta$-Skeleton graph to find cosmic
void in the LSS. Our method finds voids in dark matter halo catalogs from
N-body simulations as well as in galaxy redshift surveys.

The Beta-Skeleton has been widely used on machine learning, optimization
algorithms and image recognition and processing. It has been introduced
recently in the LSS analysis as a fast tool to identify LSS filamentary
structure, and now can detect voids also.

The morphological analysis we have performed considers voids as ellipsoids,
we study statistical properties as population size, volumes and
ellipticity. It shows a good agreement with other void finders.

The aim of this project is to use the voids as cosmic probe of Dark Energy to
make predictions for the upcoming DESI observations.
