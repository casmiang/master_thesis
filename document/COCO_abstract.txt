Large underdense regions in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, also known as voids,
are a prominent features of the cosmic web that can also be used as a cosmological probe.
In this talk, I will present a new void-finding algorithm that can be applied
to both observational and simulated data.
The algorithm is based on the $\beta$-Skeleton, an algorithm widely used on 
machine learning, optimization and image recognition;  recently it has been introduced as a 
LSS analysis tool.
The analysis we have performed, on observational and simulated data, considers voids as ellipsoids.
We study their statistical properties such as volumes and shape finding a good agreement with other void finders.
We finalize by exploring possible applications of this void finder to constrain cosmological
parameters based on data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.
